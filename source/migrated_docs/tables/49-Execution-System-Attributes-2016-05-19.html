		<tr>
			<td>available</td>
			<td>boolean</td>

		<tr>
			<td>scratchDir</td>
			<td>string</td>
			<td>Path to use for a job scratch directory. This value is the first choice for creating a job's working directory at runtime. The path will be resolved relative to the <code>rootDir</code> value in the storage config if it begins with a "/", and relative to the system <code>homeDir</code> otherwise.</td>
