### Deleting an app

```shell
curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     -X DELETE my-pyplot-demo-2.2
```

```plaintext
apps-delete -v my-pyplot-demo-2.2
```

Deleting an app is done by calling a HTTP DELETE on an app's URL. Note that deleting an app does not make its id available for reuse.
