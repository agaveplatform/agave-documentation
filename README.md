# Agave Developer Docs
> Developer documentation for the [Agave Platform](https://agaveplatform.org).

This is the repository for the Agave Platform developer docs. The code is written in markdown utilizing the [tripit.github.io/slate](http://tripit.github.io/slate)
Middleman theme.

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or OS X** â€” Windows may work, but is unsupported.
 - **Docker** - To build, test, and run.

### Getting Set Up

The documentation is built and debugged in real time with Middleman. To set up a development environment, checkout 
the code, then run the image. Once running, you can edit the code and see the changes
in real time on your local system.

```shell
# Check out the documentation source
git clone https://github.com/agaveplatform/developer-docs.git
cd developer-docs

# Run the dev server, mounting in the source code
docker run -d -p 4567:4567 \
           --name agave-documentation \
           -v $(pwd):/usr/src/docs \
           agaveplatform/doc-builder:latest bundle exec middleman server
```

You can now see the docs at <http://localhost:4567>.

Now that Slate is all set up your machine, you'll probably want to learn more about [editing Slate markdown](https://github.com/tripit/slate/wiki/Markdown-Syntax), or [how to publish your docs](https://github.com/tripit/slate/wiki/Deploying-Slate).
